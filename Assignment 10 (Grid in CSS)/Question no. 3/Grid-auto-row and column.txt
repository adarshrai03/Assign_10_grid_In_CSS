
grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns : properties in CSS used with the CSS Grid Layout module. They determine the size of rows and columns in a grid that haven't been explicitly defined using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.

grid-auto-rows:

This property is used to set the size of rows in a grid that are created implicitly (i.e., not defined using grid-template-rows).
It accepts values like lengths (pixels, percentages, etc.), fr units (flexible units), min-content, max-content, auto, etc.
If you set a specific value, like grid-auto-rows: 50px, it means that any rows that are created automatically will be 50 pixels tall.
If you set it to auto, the row will be as tall as its content.
If set to minmax(min, max), it will create rows with a minimum height of "min" and a maximum height of "max".

grid-auto-columns:

Similar to grid-auto-rows, this property sets the size of columns that are created implicitly (i.e., not defined using grid-template-columns).
It accepts the same kind of values as grid-auto-rows, like lengths, fr units, min-content, max-content, auto, etc.
If you set a specific value, like grid-auto-columns: 20%, it means that any columns that are created automatically will be 20% of the grid container's width.
If you set it to auto, the column will be as wide as its content.
If set to minmax(min, max), it will create columns with a minimum width of "min" and a maximum width of "max".
